# What this repo contains

When working with database backed Python applications I soon realized that I
lacked knowledge with SQLAlchemy. To fix this, I introduced daily 30 minute
sessions where I read the book SQLAlchemy 2 In Practice and followed along with
the implementation.

This repository contains the code I wrote and notes taken while following along
in the book.

## Technical decisions

SQLAlchemy supports multiple different databases. I choose to use SQLite due to
its simplicity, that Python has built in support for it and because it doesn't
require a separate server to run.
